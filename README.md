# BottomDriver

It is a code from my organization - NPO GIPO.

This PCB is responsible for moment motor positioning.

There are two projects:
- an old project, which was developed by my elder colleagues
- after I refactored

About refactoring.

1) Bad naming (not sustained registers, grammatical mistakes, one-letter variables)
2) Everything is allocated in main.c (cannot find needed function)
3) No abstracts, no structured structures, too few comments
4) Facaded library functions
